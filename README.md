#### Kathmandu, Nepal
**Kathmandu Nepal is my birthplace**. It is the capital city of Nepal and I was born in the suburb of Kathmandu. The valley of Kathmandu is located in the middle of country Nepal in the Asian continent. It is surrounded by mountains on all sides. I love Kathmandu because it is my birthplace and because of it's deep **historical and cultural significance**.
